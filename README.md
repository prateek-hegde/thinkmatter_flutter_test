# About app

This is a small shopping app with most of code already written
There are two screens

1. MenuScreen
   It has list of all items (products). Tapping a item should add it to cart
   ItemTile shows details regarding name, img, price of product
   
2. CartScreen
   Tapping cart icon in top-right of menu screen takes you to cart
   Here all items added to cart should be displayed along with quantity
   Add button to remove item from cart
   
Take a look at providers/cart.dart for helper methods and data model
